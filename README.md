# Amazon-Performance-Report
This is an individual project using PowerBi where I have created an interactive dashboard to track and analyse the year wise sales of Amazon with respect to various products and countries.
In this project I have:
  - Used various parameters to drill down into the worksheet and customize it using filters and slicers.
  - Used different types of customized visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, maps and cards.
    
Using the aforementioned parameters I was able to analyse the following KPIs:
  - Sales by segment
  - Sales by market
  - Profit by Customer Name
  - Top and Bottom 5 by product
  - Sales by Country
  - Sales Projection
    
*Global Superstore.xlsx* contains the dataset for this project. **Here is a screenshot of how the dataset looks like.**
